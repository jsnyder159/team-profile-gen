#   Team Profile Generator  

  ## Description
  I created a team profile generator that will take in information from questions in the terminal, and will produce an HTML page with all the associated information.  It's a quick and easy way to
  put all of your teams information in one spot for other teams, or company members to locate and get a quick run down on your team.
